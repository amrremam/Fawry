# Fawry E-Commerce System (Java)

This is a basic object-oriented Java application that simulates a mini e-commerce system with features such as:

- Product definition (expirable, shippable, etc.)
- Customer cart handling
- Checkout and payment processing
- Shipment generation for shippable items

> Built as part of the **Fawry Quantum Internship Challenge**
